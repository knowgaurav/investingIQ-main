## Must-Follow Development Principles

### 🚫 What NOT to Do
- ❌ Don't over-engineer — No defensive checks, complicated methods for type checking, unnecessary field or variables
- ❌ Don't add unused features or extreme edge cases — Build only what's specified
- ❌ Don't use multiple databases — Mongodb API using Cosmos DB with Beanie ODM only
- ❌ Don't create complex abstractions — Keep it direct and simple
- ❌ Don't optimize prematurely — Make it work first
- ❌ Don't leave TODOs — Complete everything
- ❌ Don't add validators or fallback behaviours “just in case” — we own every caller, so keep schemas and services strict and fill fields correctly at the source
- ❌ Don't mark arguments optional unless the flow truly allows omission — every parameter should be explicit and required by default

Remember:
- Working > Perfect
- Simple > Complex
- Complete > Partial
- Clear > Clever

### 🏗️ Development Principles
- Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
- No over-architecture — Build what's needed, not what might be needed
- No premature optimization — Make it work, then make it fast (only if needed)
- No complex abstractions — Direct, readable code over clever or complex patterns
- Minimal files — Combine related logic, split only when it improves clarity
